## INTRODUCTION

As Bangladesh advances into the digital era, it faces new challenges in ensuring cybersecurity, data privacy, and safeguarding online rights. The country's rapid digital transformation, driven by the “Digital Bangladesh” initiative, has exposed gaps in its existing cyber laws, many of which have been criticized for vagueness and lack of protection for basic rights.

To shape a more secure and rights-respecting digital future, this project examines the cyber law frameworks of five globally recognized peaceful and technologically advanced nations—Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, and the United States. Drawing lessons from these countries, the project proposes two legislative reforms tailored for Bangladesh, aiming to enhance both digital security and civil liberties.

## EXISTING CYBER LAWS OF BANGLADESH

Bangladesh’s legal landscape around digital issues is evolving but faces significant shortcomings:

1. **Digital Security Act (DSA), 2018**
   - Targets cybercrimes: hacking, fraud, phishing, cyberbullying, fake news.
   - Criminalizes defamation, religious offense, and spread of false information.
   - Criticized for vague language, potential to suppress free speech, and warrantless arrests.

2. **Pornography Control Act, 2012**
   - Bans creation, sharing, and storage of pornography online.
   - Lacks clear definitions and effective enforcement on digital platforms.

3. **Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act, 2006**
   - Pioneered legal recognition of e-transactions, digital signatures.
   - Section 57, now repealed, was controversial for misuse against free speech.

4. **Telecommunication Act, 2001**
   - Covers telecom services and digital communications.
   - Grants broad surveillance powers, with overlapping mandates and limited privacy safeguards.

5. **Draft Data Protection Act**
   - Aims to regulate personal data usage.
   - Criticized for excessive government control and lack of independent oversight.

### Key Challenges
- Overlapping, outdated, and sometimes contradictory laws.
- Absence of a robust, dedicated data protection regime.
- Inadequate technical knowledge among law enforcement.
- Insufficient resources for investigating and prosecuting cybercrimes.
- Emphasis on security over individual rights.

## PROPOSED LEGAL REFORMS FOR BANGLADESH

Drawing from global best practices, two new legislative proposals are recommended:

### 1. National Digital Security and Accountability Act

**Inspiration:**  
- USA's CISA, Switzerland's NCSC, Estonia's critical infrastructure model.

**Purpose:**  
- To centralize and modernize digital security oversight, mandate reporting, and protect critical infrastructure.

**Key Features:**
- Establish a National Digital Security Authority (NDSA).
- Mandate cybersecurity standards for critical sectors (banking, healthcare, education, government).
- Compulsory reporting and auditing of cyber incidents.
- Promote government-private sector cooperation.
- Enforceable guidelines to prevent abuse of surveillance.

**Expected Benefits:**
- Enhanced digital trust and security.
- Faster, more organized response to cyber threats.
- Clear accountability and protection of citizens’ rights.

### 2. Cyber Freedom and Rights Protection Act

**Inspiration:**  
- Digital freedom models in Finland, Denmark, Iceland, and UN online rights guidance.

**Purpose:**  
- To clarify and protect digital expression, guard against misuse of cyber laws, and ensure judicial oversight.

**Key Features:**
- Clear definitions of cyber defamation, hate speech, and public interest speech.
- Judicial approval required for arrests related to online speech.
- Training for law enforcement on digital rights.
- Creation of an independent ombudsman for digital rights grievances.
- Penalties for misuse of power and violations of civil rights.

**Expected Benefits:**
- Protection for journalists, students, and citizens expressing opinions online.

## CONCLUSION

Bangladesh stands at a crossroads in its digital journey. By learning from successful models in other nations, it can enact reforms that balance security and freedom, foster digital trust, and protect individual rights. The proposed acts—National Digital Security and Accountability Act and the Cyber Freedom and Rights Protection Act—offer a blueprint for a resilient and inclusive digital future.

Collaboration among government, technical experts, civil society, and the wider public is essential to ensure these reforms are effective and widely supported.
